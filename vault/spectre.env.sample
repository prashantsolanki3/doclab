# When you're running Firefly III under a (self-signed) certificate,
# the Spectre importer may have trouble verifying the TLS connection.
#
# You have a few options to make sure the CSV importer can connect
# to Firefly III:
# - 'true': will verify all certificates. The most secure option and the default.
# - 'file.pem': refer to a file (you must provide it) to your custom (root or intermediate) certificates.
# - 'false': will verify NO certificates. Not very secure.

#
# Imagine Firefly III can be reached at "http://172.16.0.2:8082" (internal Docker network or something).
# But you have a fancy URL: "https://personal-finances.bill.microsoft.com/"
#
# In those cases, you can overrule the URL so when the Spectre importer links back to Firefly III, it uses the correct URL.
# (please don't add a trailing slash btw)
#

#
# If you want, you can set a directory here where the CSV importer will look for import configurations.
# This is a separate setting from the /import directory that the auto-import uses.
# Setting this variable isn't necessary. The default value is "storage/configurations".
